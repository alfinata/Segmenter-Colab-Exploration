# Simple Converter Notebook
This simple code converts annotated label in image form to txt file which represents the class each pixel. This is made in order to make the labeling of the dataset similar to the example in the [MMSegmentation tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/blob/master/demo/MMSegmentation_Tutorial.ipynb). The author hasn't learned deeper into the formatting of the dataset that is supported, and in the future this step might be unnecessary.

Examples of the raw image, annotated image, and conversion result can be seen in the files listed here.
